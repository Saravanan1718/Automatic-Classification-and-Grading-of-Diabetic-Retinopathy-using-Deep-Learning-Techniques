# Automatic-Classification-and-Grading-of-Diabetic-Retinopathy-using-Deep-Learning-Techniques
Diabetic Retinopathy (DR)  is a abnormality caused due to Diabeties. So  we have to detect the stage of DR  at eariler stage.
Our aim is to classify the Fundus images into Grades 0 to 4 .
Based on the Grades we can tell which grade we are in and cure according to that.
      Grade 0 - Healthy Retina
	    Grade 1 - Mild NPDR
	    Grade 2 - Moderate NPDR
	    Grade 3 - Severe NPDR 
	    Grade 4 - Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy
We propose a deep learning approach involving two steps I.e  feature extraction and classification. We compare the results of different deep learning algorithms like ResNet 50 , ResNet 18 , VGG 16 , VGG19 and AlexNet, implementing CNN algorithms in our model, which provide better results for image classification. Atlast we have also designed a Neural network on our own which consists of 18 layers and trained it on APTOS dataset and it outperformed some pretrained models.
